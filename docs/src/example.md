An introductory example is given in `examples/run_plasma.jl`. This script will recreate Figure E1 from [Fouvry & Prunet (2021).](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.509.2443F/abstract)

Download the file by running:
```
wget ttps://github.com/JuliaStellarDynamics/FiniteHilbertTransform.jl/blob/main/examples/run_plasma.jl
```
Run the code with the following command:
```
$ julia /path/to/run_plasma.jl
```

This example will first install some required libraries (`Plots`, `ArgParse`) as needed. These installations might take a few minutes when first called.

The resulting plot will be created in the same folder where you executed the script, and will be called `plasmademo.png`.
